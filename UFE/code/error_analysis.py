    Once the StatsForecastobject has been instantiated, we can use the cross_validation method, which takes the following arguments:
    df: training data frame with StatsForecast format
    h (int): represents the h steps into the future that will be forecasted
    step_size (int): step size between each window, meaning how often do you want to run the forecasting process.
    n_windows (int): number of windows used for cross-validation, meaning the number of forecasting processes in the past you want to evaluate.


    The crossvaldation_df object is a new data frame that includes the following columns:
    unique_id: index. If you dont like working with index just run crossvalidation_df.resetindex()
    ds: datestamp or temporal index
    cutoff: the last datestamp or temporal index for the n_windows.
    y: true value
    "model": columns with the modelâ€™s name and fitted value.

    The actual values.
    The forecasts, in this case, AutoETS.
